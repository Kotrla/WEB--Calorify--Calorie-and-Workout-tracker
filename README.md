About:
The main objective of this application was to make it simple, by simple, i am referring to the usability of the application from any type of user which means anyone can understand it even if they aren’t that familiar with computers. While, at the same time not neglecting any feature of the application. If it’s simple to use it doesn’t mean that it has to lack features. The objective was met and i am happy with the outcome.

With these thoughts in mind, i successfully made an application whose features include the tracking of the macronutrients that the user consumed, even in the case of a custom made meal that only the user knows the recipe of, he can easily add the base ingredients to our database, set the quantity used in the recipe and still be able to follow his fitness goals, while eating delicious and creative meals. There is also a “History” tab containing the meals that the user previously consumed, if the user is curious about that. If the user added a food by mistake, he can delete it by pressing the noticeable red button.
The necessary macronutrients are automatically calculated based on the user’s fitness goals and personal information, so the user doesn’t have to think a lot about it. However, if the user isn’t happy with the results of our calculated formula, the user can freely change it and set the values as he pleases, without any restrictions. 
Besides the calorie and macronutrient tracking, this application also offers a way for the user to keep track of his workouts. He can freely add an exercise he performed by adding its name and the number of repetitions done. Of course, if he an exercise by mistake, he can easily remove it. There is also a “History” tab of the workouts, which the user can look upon and notice if he is progressing or stalling with this goals.
All of these features in combination with a simple and clean UI, provide a pleasable and non confusing user experience.

Developing this application made me realize how much I enjoy coding API’s. The MERN stack was extremely powerful, only being limited by my imagination. The implementation was done while maintaining the basic principles of programming.
