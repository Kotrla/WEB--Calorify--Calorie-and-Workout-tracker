# [WEB] Calorify: Calorie and Workout Tracker
 A web application that allows the users to track their calories, macronutrient needs and workouts

The main objective of this application was to make it simple, by simple, i am referring to the usability of the application from any type of user which means anyone can understand it even if they aren’t that familiar with computers. While, at the same time not neglecting any feature of the application. If it’s simple to use it doesn’t mean that it has to lack features. The objective was met and i am happy with the outcome.
The potential future of this application is bright. It can be further upgraded by potentially adding a separate food database, besides the main one, that is unique to each individual and can be highly customizable by the user, increasing the user’s privacy of his “secret recipes”. Also, the same concept can be applied for the workout tracking system, while still maintaining the customizability.
